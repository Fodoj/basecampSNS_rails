#### Create a Chatbot 

1. Register Basecamp and [create bot](https://m.signalvnoise.com/new-in-basecamp-3-chatbots-8526618c0c7d#.kabo3hgs1). There
you need a bot long link. Like this: 
    `https://3.basecamp.com/195539477/integrations/2uH9aHLEVhhaXKPaqrj8yw8P/buckets/2085958501/chats/9007199254741775/lines`
2. Clone this repo from GitHub.
    1. Run __`bundle install`__ in your project directory.
    2. Create a ```secrets.yml``` file in your config folder as described [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#config-secrets-yml).
3. Add your Basecamp __bot url__ to `/config/service.yml`
4. You will probably want to try running your app locally to test it and make sure itâ€™s working as expected. To do that you will need a service that allows you to expose a web server running on your local machine to the Internet. We recommend to try [Ngrok](http://ngrok.com).
    1. If you see this message on rails console:
        ``Cannot render console from XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX! Allowed networks: 127.0.0.1,...``
        You need to whitelist the XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX network space in the Web console config.
        Open ``config/environments/development.rb`` and type IP address of remote server:

        ``` config.web_console.whitelisted_ips = 'XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX' ```

    Read more about IP's whitelisting [here](https://github.com/rails/web-console#configweb_consolewhitelisted_ips).

#### AWS integration

1. Register AWS and [create SNS topic](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/CreateTopic.html). Remember Topic ARN! It looks like this:
    `arn:aws:sns:us-east-6:23730808936387:topick_name`
2. Add your SNS __Topic ARN__ to  `/config/service.yml`
3. [Aws-sdk gem](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby), which used in this App, needs 'aws_access_key' and 'aws_secret_key' to work. To find them navigate to "My Security Credentials" category in your asw.amazon account. Always load your credentials from outside your application! Look at `/config/service.yml` for example. Avoid configuring credentials statically and never commit them to source control!
    1) If you're running on AWS EC2 you able to assign AWS keys dynamically with IAM roles.
    2. Create an IAM role.
    3. Define which AWS services can assume the role (AmazonSNSFullAccess etc.)
    4. Specify the role when you launch your instance, or attach the role to a running or stopped instance. 
4. Start  rails server by typing `rails s` command.
5. [Create subscription](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SubscribeTopic.html). Use HTTP **Protocol** and  `http://your-external-host/api/sns/messages` as __Endpoint__
6. At first time SNS send confirmation request which will be automatically accepted. After subscription you can [publish messages to the topic](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/PublishTopic.html)
