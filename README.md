### Instruction

#### Create a Chatbot 

1. Register Basecamp and [create bot](https://m.signalvnoise.com/new-in-basecamp-3-chatbots-8526618c0c7d#.kabo3hgs1). There
you need a bot long link. Like this: 
    `https://3.basecamp.com/195539477/integrations/2uH9aHLEVhhaXKPaqrj8yw8P/buckets/2085958501/chats/9007199254741775/lines`
2. Clone this repo from GitHub.
    1. Run __`bundle install`__ in your project directory.
    2. Create a ```secrets.yml``` file in your config folder as described [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#config-secrets-yml).
3. Add your Basecamp __bot url__ to `/config/service.yml`
4. You will probably want to try running your app locally to test it and make sure itâ€™s working as expected. To do that you will need a service that allows you to expose a web server running on your local machine to the Internet. We recommend to try [Ngrok](http://ngrok.com).
    1. If you see this message on rails console:
        ``Cannot render console from XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX! Allowed networks: 127.0.0.1,...``
        You need to whitelist the XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX network space in the Web console config.
        Open ``config/environments/development.rb`` and type IP address of remote server:

        ``` config.web_console.whitelisted_ips = 'XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX' ```

    Read more about IP's whitelisting [here](https://github.com/rails/web-console#configweb_consolewhitelisted_ips).

#### AWS integration

1. Register AWS and [create SNS topic](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/CreateTopic.html). Remember Topic ARN! It looks like this:
    `arn:aws:sns:us-east-6:23730808936387:topick_name`
2. Add your SNS __Topic ARN__ to  `/config/service.yml`
3. Start  rails server by typing `rails s` command.
4. [Create subscription](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SubscribeTopic.html). Use HTTP **Protocol** and  `http://your-external-host/api/v1/messages` as __Endpoint__
8. At first time SNS send confirmation request. After subscription you can 
[publish messages to a topic](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/PublishTopic.html)

#### Rollbar integration

1. Create [Rollbar account](https://rollbar.com) and start the New project.
2. Navigate to the project, click 'Settings', then click 'Notifications' in the left menu.
3. Select the 'Webhook', enter the full URL where webhooks should be posted (this App server IP) and enable the integration. 
4. Once set up, you can add, edit, or remove rules. For more instruction, please visit [Rollbar docs](https://rollbar.com/docs/webhooks) and [Ruby Integration](https://rollbar.com/docs/notifier/rollbar-gem)
